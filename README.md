# Hospital-XML-DTD-XML-Schema

This repository contains an xml hospital file which describes the information inside a generic hospital. The xml file follows both DTD and XML-Schema pattern.

This repository contains a project during my postgraduate studies for the course "Semantic Web". In this project an XML file that contains information - data about a Hospital and its particular utilities was developed. The XML file is obliged to follow the restrictions from the XML - DTD file and the XML - Schema file.
